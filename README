This repository contains code for a very simple microkernel system.

Any platform-specific stuff in this code is for QEMU's "versatilepb" emulation, which emulates this board: <http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0224i/Chdbeibh.html>.

Any CPU-specific stuff is for the ARM1176 processor.  Currently compiling for little-endian, but I would like to change this.

You can run the system with:

qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -cpu arm1176 -nographic -kernel kernel.elf

Once it is running, you can shut down with ^a-x
